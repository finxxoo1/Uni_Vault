# 🎤 UniVault Demo Script for Judges

## 🎯 Opening (30 seconds)
"Hi! I'm [Your Name] and this is UniVault - we're solving the $2 billion problem of opaque campus finances. Every year, student organizations lose 5-15% to platform fees and face disputes from untraceable spending. We're fixing this with Algorand smart contracts."

## 📱 Demo Part 1: Dashboard (1 minute)

### What to Show:
1. **Open http://localhost:3000**
2. **Point to Deployment Status:**
   - "This shows our contracts are live on Algorand Testnet"
   - "Everything is verifiable on the blockchain"

3. **Show Active Vaults:**
   - "Here's our conditional vault - it only releases funds when the goal is met"
   - Click "Check Balance" to show real-time blockchain data
   - "And here's our multi-sig vault requiring 2 of 3 signatures"

4. **Show NFT Tickets:**
   - Click "View on AlgoExplorer"
   - "This is our event ticket as an NFT - completely fraud-proof"

### What to Say:

## 🏗️ Demo Part 2: Create Vault (1 minute)

### What to Show:

   - Deadline: 7 (days)

4. **Show the generated address**

### What to Say:
"Watch this - I can create a vault in seconds. The smart contract I just deployed will automatically:
- Lock the funds
- Only release them if we hit 10 ALGO before the deadline
- Return the money to contributors if we don't

This is all enforced by code on Algorand, not by a person who could make mistakes or be corrupted."

## 🔍 Blockchain Proof (30 seconds)

### What to Show:
1. **Open AlgoExplorer in new tab**
2. **Show the asset page**
3. **Point to transactions**

### What to Say:

## 💡 Problem/Solution Recap (30 seconds)

### What to Say:
"Let me recap the problems we're solving:

**Before UniVault:**
- 5-15% fees to Eventbrite, PayPal, Venmo

- Disputes over 'he said, she said'

**With UniVault:**
- 0.001 ALGO fees (less than a penny)
- Smart contracts = automatic enforcement
- Blockchain = perfect audit trail

And we're doing this with the cheapest, fastest Layer 1 - Algorand."

## ⚡ Quick Answers to Expected Questions

**Q: Why Algorand instead of Ethereum?**
A: "Fees. Ethereum gas costs would eat student budgets. Algorand transactions cost 0.001 ALGO - about $0.0003. Plus 3-second finality."

**Q: How do you make money?**
A: "Optional premium features: on-chain reputation analytics, custom branded vaults, inter-university fund transfers. But the core is free forever."

**Q: What about students without crypto wallets?**
A: "We'll integrate with Pera Wallet - scan QR, create wallet in 10 seconds. Easier than setting up Venmo."

**Q: Regulatory issues?**
A: "We're not a bank or money transmitter - we're infrastructure. Students still use fiat to buy ALGO. We're like Venmo but with blockchain."

**Q: Can't someone just screenshot a ticket?**
A: "No - we verify ownership on the blockchain at the door. A screenshot doesn't prove you own the NFT."
